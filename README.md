# DPCTutorial
Yalmip implementation of data-driven predictive controllers

Matlab files that build SPC, DeePC and offset-free SPC and DeePC, respectively, from data generated by a linear discrete-time system.

The PADC file generates the system dynamics and constraints for a power amplifier example.

If you define your own linear system you do not need to call the PADC function.

Comments are provided for each data-driven predictive controller implementation on how to modify data generation, noise, disturbance and tuning.
